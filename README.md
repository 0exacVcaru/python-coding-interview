# *The Comprehensive Manual to Algorithms in Python*
## *And a Coding Interview Guidebook that Uses LeetCode Questions*

## The Purpose of *The Comprehensive Coding Interview Guide*
Partially open sourced content from my book series, with the working title *The Comprehensive Manual to Algorithms in Python*. This book series uses Python 3 as its programming language due to its popularity and easiness to implement in real coding inteview. The purpose of the book is to guide the audience to prepare for real-world software engineering, include but not limited by preparing and cracking the coding interviews. We guide our audience to  master data structures, algorithm design and analysis, problem-patterns through playing around with toy examples coded in Python throughly. Analyzing the behavior and computation complexity of more restricted, clear-defined problems in the book helps lay the foundation of solving real-world prblems which are more open and challenging. This is NOT a book that gives you quick tricks to pass a few coding interviews, it is a book designed to learn and be passion about the algorithms. Use the expecation of cracking the coding interview as a joy boost and motivation to learn and benefit the whole-career.

## Part 1: Learning: Data Structures and Algorithms Explained with LeetCode Problems
As the first part of the series, this part includes: 
1. Introduction, 
2. Fundamental Algorithm
Design and Analysis (divide and conquer, complexity analysis), 
3. Data Structures (connect the doubts of data structures and Python built-in data types/Modules), 
4. Complete Search (searching on linear data structres, graph, tree), 
5. Advanced Algorithm Design (Dynamic programming, greedy algorithm),
6. Math and Bit Manipulation

LeetCode problems as used as exercise, only id and the title of the questions are given.
## Part 2: Cracking: The LeetCode Problem Catalog
The Second part of the series focusing on catagorize problems and solve them type by type.
1. Dynamic Programming Questions (15%)
2. Array Questions (15%)
3. Linked List, Stack, Queue, and Heap Questions (12%)
4. String Questions (15%)
5. Tree Questions (10%)
6. Graph Questions (15%)

## Feedback
If you like the example chapters that I put here, please leave your comment here. This book comes with a lot of hard work --personally, I paused my PhD program for a semester to focus on. Therefore, your comment is important to lead to the publication of the work. 

If you have ideas to improve the book, about formatting, more contents, or correct the errors are also very welcome too.
